Project Background: Video Integration Using HTML and CSS
Introduction

In the modern era of web development, creating interactive, engaging, and visually appealing websites is a core focus. Videos are a key component in enhancing user experience by providing rich content and delivering messages more effectively than static images or text alone. Integrating video content into a website has become increasingly important for businesses, educational platforms, and personal projects to capture the audience's attention and convey information in a dynamic format.

This project involves embedding and styling a video using HTML and CSS. The goal is to demonstrate how videos can be integrated into a webpage in a seamless, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing way while ensuring that it adheres to the best practices of web design and user experience.
